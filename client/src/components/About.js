            <p>Gear Trader was created with adventure in mind. Money should 
                never be an obstacle to enjoying the outdoors. We wanted to give 
                adventurers a chance to earn some cash for gear they don't need and 
                grab some great gear for a low price. Spend more time in nature and 
                less time worrying about how to get there.</p>
